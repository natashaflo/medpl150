    <h1>Natasha's MEDPL 150 Portfolio</h1>
    <h2>Creative statement</h2>
     <p>I want to create media that allows me to communicate to others what I cannot express verbally. Creating media that translates what I am thinking or experiencing at different moments in my life can let me reflect on different stages of growth or experiences that others can connect to. Through the use of videos and images I use everyday objects and places to visualize different ideas that people can relate to. I would describe my work as being very based in reality and focused on presenting the beauty of the mundane so everyday objects or places like train stations, alleyways, buildings, furniture etc all hold some element of comfort or meaning to the audience. I like to the explore the evolution of oneâ€™s growth through reflection and how that can very from person to person. I like to work in digital media because it allows me to use editing tools to help capture what I envision and refine those ideas.
I want people to connect to my media in the sense that I can create identification, compassion and understanding within my artwork and the audience. My background plays a vital role in determining what stories I wish to tell and how I tell them. Themes of suffering, coming of age, and perseverance are integral to creating works that other people can relate to and take into their own lives.</p>
