    <h1>Natasha's MEDPL 150 Portfolio</h1>
    <h2>Creative statement</h2>
     <p>I want to create media that allows me to communicate to others what I cannot do verbally.<br>Creating media that translates what I am thinking or experiencing at different moments in my life let me reflect on different stages of growth or experiences that others can connect to.<br>Through the use of video and images
      I can use everyday objects and places to visualize different ideas that people can observe and dissect.</p>
